          <ul class="check-list m-t">
            <li>Chocolatey builds on technologies you know - unattended installation and PowerShell. Chocolatey works with all existing software installation technologies like MSI, NSIS, InnoSetup, etc, but also works with runtime binaries and zip archives. Go <a href="/compare">Pro/Business</a> to dial that experience up to 11!</li>
            <li>Easily manage all aspects of Windows software (installation, configuration, upgrade, and uninstallation). Chocolatey is the most reliable when software is included in the package, but can also easily download resources.</li>
            <li>Take advantage of PowerShell to provide automated software management instructions and Chocolatey’s <a href="@Url.RouteUrl(RouteName.Docs, new { docName = "helpers-reference" })">built-in module</a> to turn complex tasks into one line function calls!</li>
